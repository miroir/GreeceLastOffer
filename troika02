CHAPTER 2. VAT reform
Adopt legislation to reform the VAT system that will be effective as of July 1, 2015. The reform will target a net revenue gain of 1 percent of GDP on an annual basis from parametric changes. The new VAT system will:
(i) unify the rates at a standard 23 percent rate, which will includerestaurants, hotels and catering, and a reduced 13 percent rate for basic food, energy, and water (excluding sewage),and a super-reduced rate of 6 percent for pharmaceuticals, books, and theater; 
(ii) streamline exemptions to broaden the base and raise the tax on insurance; and 
(iii) eliminate discounts, including on islands.

The increase of the VAT rate described above may be reviewed at the end of 2016, provided that equivalent additional revenues are collected through measures taken against tax evasion and to improve collectability of VAT.
Any decision to review shall take place in consultation with the institutions.
