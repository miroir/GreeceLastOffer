NOTE: Althought 'miroir' is the French word for 'mirror' **I am not in any way related to FT's Peter Spiegel** ('Spiegel' is the German word for 'mirror')!

Greek offer in greek.* , Troika offer in troika.*

The PDF files were first converted with **pdftotext** and split with **csplit --digits=2  --quiet --prefix=greece greece.txt "/CHAPTER/" {"*"}** (the *CHAPTER* tag was inserted before splitting - it is not part of the original content). The separated files were manually reformatted. For the originally extracted content please refer to the PDF version or the unedited text files *greece.txt* and *troika.txt*.
