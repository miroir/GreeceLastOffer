CHAPTER 4. Pension reform
(MISSING)

Effective from 31 October 2015 the authorities will phase-in reforms that would deliver estimated permanent savings of ¼-½ percent of GDP in 2015 and 1 percent of GDP on a full year basis in 2016 and thereafter by adopting legislation to:

• create strong disincentives to early retirement, including the adjustment of early retirement penalties, and through a gradual elimination of grandfathering to statutory retirement age and early retirement pathways progressively adapting to the limit of statutory retirement age of [67] years,or 62 and 40 years of contributions by 2022, applicable for all those retiring (except arduous professions, and mothers with children with disability) after October 31, 2015; Adopt legislation so that withdrawals from the Social Insurance Fund will incur an annual penalty, for those affected by the extension of the retirement age period, equivalent to 10 percent on top of the current penalty of 6 percent;

• Integrate into ETEA all supplementary pensions funds;

• Better target social pensions by increasing OGA uninsured pension;

• Gradually replace the solidarity grant (EKAS) for all pensioners by end-December 2018;

• increase health contributions for pensioners from 4% to 5% on average and extend to supplementary pensions;

• restore employer contribution for main pensions to 2014 levels(3.9% - IKA);

• increase contributions for supplementary pensions from 3 to 3.5%; and

• phase out all state-financed exemptions and gradually harmonize contribution rules for all pension funds in line with contributions to IKA from 1 January 2016.

Moreover, in order to restore the sustainability of the pension system, the authorities will by 31 October 2015, legislate further reforms to take effect from 1, January 2016

(ii) broaden and modernize the contribution and pension base for all self-employed, including by switching from notional to actual income, subject to minimum required contribution rules;

(iii) rationalize all different systems of basic, guaranteed contributory and means tested pension components, taking into account incentives to work and contribute;

(iv) the main elements of a comprehensive SSFs consolidation, including any remaining harmonization of contribution and benefit payment rules and procedures across all funds;

(v) abolish most nuisance charges financing pensions and offset by reducing benefits or increasing contributions in specific funds to take effect from 31 October 2015; and

(vi) harmonize pension benefit rules of the agricultural fund (OGA) with the rest of the pension system in a pro rata manner, unless OGA is merged into other funds. The consolidation of social insurance funds will take place by end 2018 over a period of three years. In 2015, the process will be activated through legislation to consolidate the social insurance funds and the operational consolidation will have been completed by 31 December 2016. Further reductions in the operating costs and a more effective management of fund resources including improved balancing of needs between better-off and poorer-off funds will be actively encouraged. The codification of the insurance law will be completed in the immediate future and will correspond to the new organization of the new and more integrated social security system.

The authorities will adopt legislation to fully offset the fiscal effects of the implementation of court rulings on the 2012 pension reform.
